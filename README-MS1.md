This is the website for Nicer Tours, a new company offering sightseeing tours of the South of France.

Nicer Tours guarantee tour departures through their "Guaranteed Departure" tour option, the only tour company able to offer this.
Since tours have to be economically viable, many tours are cancelled during the off-season. Guaranteed departure allows the company to 
run a profitable organisation all year round.

However, the Guaranteed Departure option is not heavily promoted, because promoting a loss-leader is not a good business idea. Regular 
(Flexible Departures) are promoted as a means to allow the customer to believe they are getting the best possible deal, since they 
always pay the lowest price in this option. Equally, promoting Flexible Departure options allows the company to run with a maximum 
amount of customers for each tour.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories:
    - #### First time visitors:
		1) As a first time visitor, I am either planning or am on my vacation in Nice, France and I want to visit a website that informs me about the most interesting sights and places I can visit while on this vacation.

        2) I want to have my interest aroused while I view the website, and thus choose to make a booking for a tour.

        3) As a first time visitor to the website and perhaps to the geographical area covered in the site, and being on vacation, I do not want to feel pressured into buying. However a little special offer may help me choose this company rather than another.

        4) I want to be able to navigate through the website easily, and be prompted where necessary to either contact the site creators (and service vendor) or make a booking easily if I choose to.

        5) As a first time visitor who is also on vacation, I want to be sure that I have made the right choice of tour company, so customer reviews and social comments about the company are very important.

    - #### Returning visitors:

        1) As a returning visitor, I want to be able to add my story to the many reviews I have seen on the website.

        2) As I will be returning to the site almost definitely after having taken a tour, I want to both be reminded of the fun I had, and also be able to inform others about the service offered by the company. Thus, good navigation and design are important, but so is the general informative nature of the services and sights offered on the site.

    - #### Frequent visitors:

        1) As a frequent visitor, I will probably be a professional in the tourist industry, since most people visit specific areas on vacation once only.

- ### Design:
    - #### Colour scheme:
        The project uses three main colours, all emblematic of the city of Nice. These three colours are the Yves Klein International Blue, contrasted with orange, and a pure white.

        1) Nice - main city of the *Côte d'Azur* which in itself means Blue Coast - is famous for its blue skies and blue sea. The Yves Klein International Blue (rgb 0,47,167) was created by the artist Yves Klein, himself born in Nice.

        2) Orange reminds the viewer of the Mediterranean sun, and is also the opposite of blue on colour wheels.

        3) A pure, simple white background was chosen as white represents light, another quality for which Nice and the surrounding area 
        is famous.

    - #### Typography:

        Again, two distinct font styles have been used, but each compliments the other.

        1) Titles, headings and other "special use cases" (for example, the Call To Action banner) use the Poiret One font. This font was chosen as it represents the *Belle Epoque* era of the 1920s and 30s, a time when the *Côte d'Azur* and Nice itself were
amongst the most fashionable of destinations.

        2) The Open Sans font was chosen as the typeset for the main body of the website. Although Poiret One is an extremely elegant font, it would have been overkill to use this font uniquely. Thus, the equally elegant Open Sans font was chosen to compliment Poiret One.

        Both fonts use Sans Serif as a fallback if for in any case the chosen fonts do not render.

    - #### Imagery:

        The website is designed to entice the user to either take a tour, to dream of their upcoming vacation or to tempt first time users to choose Nice and the *Côte d'Azur* for their next vacation destination. It is for this reason that wide panoramic photos have been used for the banners to each page, while scrolling images (carousels) have been used as a further navigational aid on the home page.

## Features:
-	This website is fully responsive.

-	It includes certain interactive elements, such as modals and popovers.

-	Although the project is not being marked on the inclusion of JavaScript elements, I have chosen to include one in the inclusion of the Call To Action popover. I included it for the challenge of making it work.

## Technologies Used:
- ### Languages:
	[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

	[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

	[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

- ### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs:

	[Bootstrap v4.5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/) forms the vast majority of the "formatting code" (the grid system, containers, button elements etc.) of this website. It was used because of its responsiveness and because it is compatible with so many browsers. While the underlying code may be from Bootstrap, I have in places heavily modified it (or tried to!). A good example of this is the Navigation bar. The colours used, the position of the site name and the colour of the "burger" icon. Credit for additional code used within is given in the HTML files themselves.

	[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used to import the different fonts (Poiret One and Open Sans) used on this website.

	[Font Awesome v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) was used for the social icons seen in the footer of each page.

	[Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) was used for the little piece of JavaScript in this project: the positioning of the popover in the Call To Action.

	[Git](https://git-scm.com) was used for version control.

	[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used as the writing tool. 

	[GitHub](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used as the repository for the files within this project.

	[Preview for Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/preview/welcome/mac) was used for image sizing (both in terms of height and width, and weight of file).

	[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) was used for the creation of the wireframes.

    [Compress PNG](https://compresspng.com/) was used for compressing images in the User Stories section of this README.md file.

## Testing:

The W3C [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) code verification tools were used to ensure there were no code errors in this project.

- ### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
	- #### First Time Visitor Goals
		1) As a first time visitor, I am either planning or am on my vacation in Nice, France and I want to visit a website that informs me about the most interesting sights and places I can visit while on this vacation.
        
			-	Upon opening this website, the user is presented with a stunning banner image of the Bay of Angels. 
        	-	Within the navigation menu on desktop, the user can clearly discern three "must-see" places, and is led to them via this menu: 
            [Desktop Navigation](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/nav-menu-desktop.png)
            -	Upon opening this website on portable tablets, although the navigation menu is hidden by the "burger” icon, the user can still clearly see the most 
            interesting places to visit, since the 3 carousels are directly beneath the main banner image. A tag-line for each place is followed by a link that allows the user 
            to discover more about their choice of destination. (It is precisely for this reason that the Call-to-Action is positioned beneath the carousels on smaller devices.): 
            [Tablet Navigation image](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/nav-menu-tablet.png)

    	2) I want to have my interest aroused while I view the website, and thus choose to make a booking for a tour.
        	-	The user's interest is aroused, but not overwhelmed. This is achieved in different ways, depending on the screen size the user uses.
                -	On larger devices (desktops and tablets), the user is presented with a carousel of images of the destination, with a brief summary of the place itself.
                Should the user wish to discover more within the site page, each white background description button expands to reveal more information. To the left,
                the user can see two blue buttons, one of which is called "Book Now!" and leads the user to the booking page: 
                [Desktop Book Now button, tour pages](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/tour-page-info-expand-and-book-buttons-desktop.png)
                -   On smaller mobile devices (telephones rather than tablets), the user is presented with the same carousel, a simple tag line and the description buttons 
                expand to reveal more information. Similarly,
                beneath the tour departure times information, the user can be taken to the booking page via the blue "Book Now!" button: 
                [Smartphone Book Now button, tour pages](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/tour-page-info-expand-and-book-buttons-mobile.png)

    	3) As a first time visitor to the website and perhaps to the geographical area covered in the site, and being on vacation, I do not want to feel pressured into buying. 
        However a little special offer may help me choose this company rather than another.
        	-	Since the first time visitor is most likely to be accessing the site on a smaller device, the visitor has access first and foremost to the destinations. 
            From each destination page, should the user choose, they can make a booking (see images in previous section for booking buttons). 
        	-	The Call-to-Action on the home page for smaller devices is situated beneath the carousels precisely to hint, rather than lead. 
            There _is_ the possibility of a little offer, should the user choose to accept it: 
            [Smaller device "Call-to-Action" prominence, home page](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/call-to-action-prominence-home-home-page-portable-devices.png) 
            -   The Call-to-Action is also repeated, but this time more prominently, on the page where the offer applies. It is not a repetitive pop up screaming from each page, 
            but rather, a simple reminder: 
            [All devices "Call-to-Action" prominence, tour pages](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/call-to-action-prominence-home-tour-page-all-devices.png)
            -   Equally, it is for this reason that the booking page is not featured in the top level navigation links.

    	4) I want to be able to navigate through the website easily, and be prompted where necessary to either contact the site creators (and service vendor) or make a booking 
        easily if I choose to.
        	-	From experience with people of an older generation, the carousel beneath the banner image is very important for ease of navigation. 
            The developer has had feedback from numerous people of that generation that they still are not used to navigating through the burger icon. 
            The carousels also allow for growth within the business - as new tours are developed and marketed, each carousel can be replaced with what is currently the 
            biggest seller, or most appealing tour. Accordingly, this allows for the navigation menu (whether as an icon, or as a text menu) to grow into possible subsections 
            or destinations (for example, half day tours, full day tours, private tours, shore excursions for cruise ship passengers…)
        	-	The buttons in the Call-to-Action on the home page allows the customer to note the offer code by pressing the Discount Code button, find out more (directs 
            to the tour page in question, and thus this button is absent in the tour page Call-to-Action) and make a booking from the same place: 
            [Call-to-Action buttons, tour pages](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/call-to-action-buttons-home-page.png)
        	-	From each tour page, should the user wish, the possibility to either contact the site creator or make a booking is clearly presented with bold blue buttons. 
            [Desktop Contact Us button, tour pages](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/tour-page-info-expand-and-book-buttons-desktop.png)
        	-	Similarly, the footer section of each page is interactive: 
            	-	Each icon links to something, whether that is Facebook or WhatsApp;
            	-	The contact email address and telephone numbers are live linked;
            	-	The destinations are listed and are live linked.
                -   [Footer, all pages](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/footer.png)

    	5) As a first time visitor who is also on vacation, I want to be sure that I have made the right choice of tour company, so customer reviews and social comments 
        about the company are very important.
        	-	On the home page, whether on smaller devices or larger ones, there are some clearly displayed customer reviews. These, of course, can be added to over time. 
            Eventually, it may even be advantageous to add a reviews page to the site, hence there is a link to send in reviews with photos of the customers on the tour as 
            well as links to review sites such as TripAdvisor: 
            ["Review us" links, home page](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/reviews-section-home-page.png)
        	-	Within the footer on each page, the visitor has access to the company’s Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and (most importantly) TripAdvisor pages. 
            These pages offer unbiased reviews, and are openly accessible to eventual customers: 
            [Social links, all pages](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/footer.png)

	- #### Repeat Visitor Goals
    	1) As a returning visitor, I want to be able to add my story to the many reviews I have seen on the website.
        	-	The returning visitor should not need to access the destination pages in order to leave a review. But conversely, the visitor should be able to leave a review in 
            different places, since reviews left directly with the site owners can be policed, and may thus be biased. Consequently, on the home page, the visitor has the 
            option via prominent buttons to leave a review either on:
            	-   Facebook;
            	-   TripAdvisor;
            	-   Or via direct communication with the company itself.
                -   [Review Us directly or through social media](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/review-us-directly-or-through-social-sites.png)
                

    	2) As I will be returning to the site almost definitely after having taken a tour, I want to both be reminded of the fun I had, and also be able to inform others about 
        the service offered by the company. Thus, good navigation and design are important, but so is the general informative nature of the services and sights offered on the site.
        	-	Navigation has been discussed heavily for the first time visitor. Please see these points, as they are the same for the repeat visitor. 
        	-	The design of the site, having as it does, easy to see access points via the bold blue buttons allows the repeat visitor to easily guide their “word-of-mouth” 
            referrals to each section of the website.

	- #### Frequent Visitor Goals
    	1) As a frequent visitor, I will probably be a professional in the tourist industry, since most people visit specific areas on vacation once only.
        	-	Most travel professionals use booking sites such as Viator. However, through Nicer Tours' intended distribution of mail-shots to professionals, the professional 
            will need to access the site itself in order to benefit from any special offers. It is partly for this that the discount popover has been included, along with the 
            easy booking options on the book now page. This also means that there is a constant flow of traffic to the site, and as a result, new tour destinations or 
            offers will be seen by a growing audience: 
            [Call-to-Action with up-to-date current offers, home page](https://justin-sawyer.github.io/nicer-tours/documentation/user-stories-screen-shots/call-to-action-current-offers.png)

- ### Further Testing
	- This website has been tested on Google Chrome, Safari, the built-in Internet browser on Samsung tablets and Xiaomi phones.

	- This website has been tested on a variety of devices such as laptop, desktop, iPad (mini, full size), iPhone (SE, 6, 10, 11), Samsung Galaxy Tab A, Xiaomi Redmi 5, and Honor 10 Lite.

	- Links were checked, double checked and triple checked.

	- Friends, family and peers were asked to review this website to check for bugs, UX issues or design errors.
