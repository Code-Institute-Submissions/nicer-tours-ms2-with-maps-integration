                    <p class="poi-text">In the second half of the 18th century, the English aristocracy took to spending the winter in Nice, 
                    enjoying the panorama along the coast. In 1820, when a particularly harsh winter further north brought an influx of beggars to Nice, 
                    the English put forward a proposal for a walkway along the sea, and the beggars were employed to construct it. It was funded 
                    by the Reverend Lewis Way and members of Holy Trinity Anglican Church.</p>

                    <p class="poi-text">The city of Nice, intrigued by the prospect of a pleasant promenade, greatly increased the scope of the work. 
                    The Promenade was first called the Camin deis Anglés (the English Way) by the Niçois in their native dialect. After the annexation of Nice 
                    by France in 1860 it was rechristened <i>La Promenade des Anglais</i>.</p>

                    the <i>Pont-Neuf</i> was the only practicable way between the old town and the modern one. The square was thus divided 
                    into two parts (North and South) in 1824. With the demolition of the Masséna Casino in 1979, <i>Place Masséna</i> became 
                    more spacious and less dense and is now bordered by red ochre buildings of Italian architecture.</p>

                    <p class="poi-text">The recent rebuilding of the tramline gave the square back to the pedestrians, restoring its status as a real

                    become over the years. Since its construction, <i>Place Masséna</i> has always been the spot for great public events. 
                    It is used for concerts, and particularly during the summer festivals, the <i>Corso carnavalesque</i> (carnival parade) in February, 
                    the military procession of 14 July (Bastille Day) or other traditional celebrations and banquets.</p>`,

                    <p class="poi-text">The similarity between this building and the Cathedral of Notre- Dame in Paris is more than obvious, 
                    but that doesn't stop it from standing as a real symbol of Nice. In fact, this basilica is the largest in the city, and it's even 
                    bigger than the city's cathedral.</p>

                    <p class="poi-text">It was designed by Louis Lenormand in a neo-gothic style and was erected in 1868.
                    The two square towers that support the facade measure 31 metres tall, and between these is a beautiful rose window that shows scenes of the 
                    Assumption of Mary (whom it's named after).</p>

                    <p class="poi-text">The absence of a large number of sculptures at the main entrance is notable, but a lack of funding during its construction 
                    forced it to be decorated in a much more modest fashion. However, its lack of spires is a deliberate architectural choice!</p>`,

                    <p class="poi-text">In the mid-19th century, Russian nobility visited Nice and the French Riviera, following the 
                    trend established decades earlier by the English upper class and nobility. In 1864, immediately after the railway reached Nice, 
                    Tsar Alexander II visited by train and was attracted by the pleasant climate. Thus began an association between Russians and the 
                    French Riviera that continues to this day.</p>

                    <p class="poi-text">The cathedral, consecrated in December 1912 in memory of Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsarevich of Russia, who died in 
                    Nice, was meant to serve the large Russian community that had settled in Nice by the end of the 19th century, as well as devout visitors 
                    from the Imperial Court. Tsar Nicholas II funded the construction work.</p>

                    <p class="poi-text">After 1917, Communist persecution of religion in Russia led some Russian Orthodox dioceses abroad to form jurisdictions 
                    not affiliated with Moscow. One of these, the Paris-based exarchate, later assumed control of the Nice Cathedral.</p>

                    <p class="poi-text">Since 2013, the cathedral has been the property of the Russian Federation. Effectively, as you visit the cathedral and its park, 
                    you are in Russia!</p>`,
